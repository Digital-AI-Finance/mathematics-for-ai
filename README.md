## About

This is the companion website for a 45-minute talk aimed at high school students (ages 16-18) at a university conference. It covers:

- **Fraud Detection** -- How probability and pattern recognition catch suspicious transactions
- **Credit Scoring** -- Why your financial "grade" is a weighted average
- **Recommendation Engines** -- The same math behind TikTok and Spotify powers banking apps
- **AI Ethics** -- Who decides what data the AI should use?

Featuring stories from the history of mathematics (Gauss, Bayes, Nightingale, Lovelace, Wald, and more), interactive exercises, and real formulas rendered beautifully.

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks, no build tools)
- [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for mathematical formula rendering
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Organization

Part of [Digital-AI-Finance](https://github.com/Digital-AI-Finance) -- research and education at the intersection of digital finance and artificial intelligence.
